# UW Waitlisters - Spring 2023

## What is UW Waitlisters?

Office Hours offer students the ability to consult with the teaching faculty individually for help with a variety of issues: homework, lecture concepts, grading, test review, and more. UW Waitlisters offers a variety of features to better facilitate Office Hours events so students can recieve help in a timely manner while reducing management overhead for professors.

## Further Notes on Design
UW Waitlisters was a semester-long software project that I worked on with a team of colleagues in CS506 at UW-Madison, Spring 2023. This project was designed using the following tools...

- ### Front-End: React JS
- ### Back-End: Node JS
- ### Databse: MYSQL 

This application also utilized docker containers for better project distribution and management.

and [InstructorView.js](https://github.com/ClassicMike48/UWWaitlisters/blob/main/waitlist-frontend/src/pages/InstructorView.js) in designing the waitlist view along with corresponding [Student API](https://github.com/ClassicMike48/UWWaitlisters/blob/main/waitlist-backend/routes/studentRoutes.js) | [Instructor API](https://github.com/ClassicMike48/UWWaitlisters/blob/main/waitlist-backend/routes/instructorRoutes.js) calls required to relay info between the Front-End and Database.
